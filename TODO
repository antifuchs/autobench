* make CMUCL alone work (ploticus doesn't like displaying empty columns)

* logarithmic scaling of the y axis

* lots of experiments {-:

* CLisp

* <Xophe> antifuchs: another (more blue-sky TODO): an option to plot the x-axis by date rather than by version increment

* <delYsid> antifuchs: Now that I "see" this, boinkmarks is completely inaccessible.  Can you add useable alt tags to your html?
  <Xof> alt="[graph]"
  <delYsid> Xof: no, the hard data...
  <antifuchs> delYsid: what should be in the alt tag? the data points (seconds & standard error) for every revision in the graph?
  <delYsid> Actually, a LINK to a file listing them :)
